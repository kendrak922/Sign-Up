# Sign-up App 
This summer while volunteering at a lot of foodbanks around the Twin Cities, I noticed that organizers consitently struggled to develop a system to sign people for their shifts. The problem was, the form had to be easily accessible while also keeping volunteer information private. Thats why I developed this app. It has an incredibly simple UI, because organizers and volunteers are too busy for all the nonsense. 

This App utilized Firebase Realtime Database to update a volunteer database and Firebase Authenitication to keep that data secure. The Materialize framework and JQuery library are also implemented to display data and make changes to my data set.
