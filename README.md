# Sign-up App 
I was inspired by my volunteer work this summer to make an app that helps organizers. They struggled coordinating volunteers, because they needed to keep their information private, while also making the form accessible.
This App utilized Firebase Realtime Database to update a volunteer database and Firebase Authenitication to keep that data secure. Also uses the Materialize framework and JQuery library to display data.
